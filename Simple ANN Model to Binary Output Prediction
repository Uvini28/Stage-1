The workflow begins with uploading a CSV dataset, which is then read and processed using Pandas. The dataset is split into features and target variables, followed by dividing it into training and testing sets with a 75-25 split. A sequential ANN model is constructed with an input layer and two hidden layers using ReLU activation, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function suitable for binary classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, then trained over 100 epochs with batch size 32, while monitoring its performance on the test data. After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to determine its loss and accuracy. Finally, the modelâ€™s weights are saved to a file for future use.
